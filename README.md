Hi there! This is my **RESTful TODO-application which connected to database**

## How to start
Once you clone this repo or download zip
**you have to install all dependencies.**


**Before you start, don't forget to connect to your database.**

After all done recommendations you need to type in
your ***terminal*** a command:
