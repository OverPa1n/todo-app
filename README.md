## How to start
Once you clone this repo or download zip
you have to install all dependencies.

Also, you need to connect to your database. 
I have used **MongoDB**(locally).

After all done recommendations you need to type in
your ***terminal*** a command: 
> npm start 

My app is listened on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
please follow this host in your browser, and you will see app in action
